# Triscopic
The "Triscopic Camera Array" (TCA) is an open-source imaging platform that allows for rapid data acquisition in harsh environments for 3D surveys (e.g. photogrammetry). It is designed to be constructed from common hardware, in the field, with commodity action cameras, and is diver-portable and ROV-mountable.

TCA has been tested (and proven) in conditions down to 2-foot visibility in heavy currents with medium (estimated 50 lux) lighting in the mid-atlantic.
